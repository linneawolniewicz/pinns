    "# Physics Informed Neural Networks\n",

    "This notebook implements PINNs from Raissi et al. 2017. Specifically, the notebook adapts the code implementation of Data-Driven Solutions of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations from https://github.com/maziarraissi/PINNs, and the code by Michael Ito, to solve the force-field equation for solar modulation of cosmic rays. Michael Ito's code adaption use the TF2 API where the main mechanisms of the PINN arise in the train_step function efficiently computing higher order derivatives of custom loss functions through the use of the GradientTape data structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this application, our PINN is $h(r, p) = \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial r} + \\frac{RV}{3k} \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial p}$ where $k=\\beta(p)k_1(r)k_2(r)$ and $\\beta = \\frac{p}{\\sqrt{p^2 + M^2}}$. We will approximate $f(r, p)$ using a neural network.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have no initial data, but our boundary data will be given by $f(r_{HP}, p) = \\frac{J(r_{HP}, T)}{p^2} = \\frac{(T+M)^\\gamma}{p^2}$, where $r_{HP} = 120$ AU (i.e. the radius of Heliopause), $M=0.938$ GeV, $\\gamma$ is between $-2$ and $-3$, and $T = \\sqrt{p^2 + M^2} - M$. Or, vice versa, $p = \\sqrt{T^2 + 2TM}$.\n"
